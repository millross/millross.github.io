<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been looking at the possibility of building an asynchronous version of the <a href="http://www.pac4j.org">pac4j</a>
library, with a view to then migrating the <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/vertx-pac4j">vertx-pac4j</a> implementation to use the
asynchronous version of pac4j by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m keen (for obvious reasons) that the async version of pac4j is not tightly coupled to  one
particular asynchronous/non-blocking framework, I decided to expose the API via the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html">CompletableFuture</a> class, using
this to wrap values which will be determined in the future. However, I opted to use the <a href="http://vertx.io">vert.x</a>
framework for my asynchronous testing as a way of testing the API as it emerged. This in turn has led me to learn
some aspects of the vert.x <a href="http://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Context.html">Context</a> class which I didn&#8217;t really
understand before.</p>

<p>The information presented relates to Vert.x version 3.3.3. It is conceivable that later versions of vert.x could
render aspects of this article incorrect.</p>

<h2 id="_introduction_to_the_context_class">Introduction to the Context class</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever a vert.x <a href="http://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Handler.html">Handler</a> is executed, or the start or step
method of a verticle is called, then that execution is associated with a specific context. Generally a context is an
event-loop context and is therefore associated with an event loop thread (exceptions are covered in the Further Reading
referenced below).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contexts are propagated. When a handler is set by code running on a specific context, then that handler will also be
executed on the same context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means for example, that if the start method of a verticle instance sets a number of event bus handlers (as many
do), then they will all run on the same context as the start method for that verticle (so all handlers for that
verticle instance will share a common context).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A schematic of the relationships between non-worker verticles, contexts and eventloop threads is shown in Figure 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that each verticle effectively has only one context for handlers created by its start method, and each context is
bound to a single event-loop thread. A given event-loop thread can, however, have multiple contexts bound to it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_when_are_contexts_not_propagated">When are contexts not propagated?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a verticle&#8217;s start method is called, a new context is created. If 4 identical verticles are deployed via the
instances parameter on DeploymentOptions, the start method of each will be on a new context. This is logical as we may
not want all non-worker verticles to be bound to a single eventloop thread when multiple eventloop threads are
available.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_threading_guarantees">Threading Guarantees</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are certain consequences of the propagation of contexts to handlers as mentioned above. The most important one is
that since all handlers in a given eventloop verticle run on the same context (the one on which its start method ran),
they all run on the same eventloop thread. This gives rise to the threading guarantee within vert.x, that as long as
a given verticle is the only one to ever access a piece of state, then that state is being accessed by only one thread,
so no synchronization will be necessary.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_exception_handling">Exception Handling</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each context can have its own exception handler attached for handling exceptions which occur during event loop
processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_might_you_not_want_the_default_exception_handler">Why might you not want the default exception handler?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As one example, you might have some verticles running whose job it is to monitor other verticles, and if something
appears to go wrong with them, undeploy and restart them, a frequent pattern in an actor- or microservices- style
archictecture. So one option could be that when a supervised verticle encounters an unrecoverable error, it could
simply notify its supervisor that it has gone wrong via an eventbus message, and its supervisor could then undeploy
and redeploy (and after a number of failures in rapid succession possibly give up hope or escalate to its own
supervisor.</p>

<h2 id="_going_off_context_and_getting_back_onto_a_particular_context">Going off-context and getting back onto a particular context</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several reasons why you might execute code off-context and then want to operate back on a vert.x context when
complete. I&#8217;ll outline a couple of scenarios below</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_running_code_on_a_separate_thread">Running code on a separate thread</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly you might be using an asynchronous driver which is entirely vertx-unaware. Its code will run on non-eventloop
threads but it&#8217;s possible you may then want to use the results of that code to update information within your verticle.
If you don&#8217;t get back onto the correct context, you can&#8217;t make any guarantees about thread-safety, so your subsequent
processing needs to be run back on the correct eventloop thread.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_asynchronous_java_8_apis">Using asynchronous Java 8 APIs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>APIs such as CompletableFuture are context-unaware. In one example, I created an already completed future on the vert.x
event loop in a test. I then attached subsequent processing to it via thenRun:-</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="java"><span class="annotation">@RunWith</span>(VertxUnitRunner.class)
<span class="directive">public</span> <span class="type">class</span> <span class="class">ImmediateCompletionTest</span> {

        <span class="comment">// delay future completion by 500 ms</span>
        <span class="directive">final</span> <span class="predefined-type">String</span> threadName = <span class="predefined-type">Thread</span>.currentThread().getName();
        toComplete.complete(<span class="integer">100</span>);
        toComplete.thenRun(() -&gt; {
            assertThat(<span class="predefined-type">Thread</span>.currentThread().getName(), is(threadName));
            async.complete();
        });
    }

}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Naively one might expect this to automatically run on the context, since it hasn&#8217;t left the eventloop thread on which
the future was completed, and indeed it&#8217;s provable that it is on the correct thread. However, it will not be on the
correct context. This would mean that it wouldn&#8217;t, for example, invoke any modified exception handler attached to the
context.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_getting_back_on_context">Getting back on context</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, once we&#8217;ve left the context, it&#8217;s quite straightforward to return to it. Prior to definition of the code
block within thenRun, we can use Vertx.currentContext() or vertx.getOrCreateContext() to get a handle to the context on
which our eventloop code is running, We can then execute the code block inside a call to Context::runOnContext,
similar to</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="java">        <span class="directive">final</span> <span class="predefined-type">Context</span> currentContext = vertx.getOrCreateContext();
        toComplete.thenRun(() -&gt; {
                currentContext.runOnContext(v -&gt; {
                assertThat(<span class="predefined-type">Thread</span>.currentThread().getName(), is(threadName));
                async.complete();
            }
        });</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While getting back onto the correct context may not be critical if you have remained on the event loop thread
throughout, it is critical if you are going to invoke subsequent vert.x handlers, update verticle state or anything
similar, so it&#8217;s a sensible general approach.</p>
