<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The blog is a way of sharing things I&#8217;ve learned with pretty much anyone else who might find it. Basically if I
run into something technology-related (architecture, process, code)  which either surprises or interests me,
I&#8217;ll probably dig into it a little further and may write it up here. My main "day job" interests are JVM coding,
architecture and agility. If you have further questions regarding anything you read on the blog, please contact me at
the address above. It&#8217;s possible, though far from certain, that I will be able to help.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note - this blog started life while I was a self-employed consultant and went dormant for a while, but as of 2020 I&#8217;m
resurrecting it, as much for my own future reference as anything else.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2017-10-25</strong>
In my <a href="completion-stage-future-introduction.html">previous post</a> on the subject of CompletableFutures and CompletionStages, I gave a brief introduction to the concepts. I also focused primarily on non-exceptional completion of futures, despite the fact that the original driver for writing the posts was because I&#8217;d been learning about exceptional behaviours in CompletionStage pipelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary reason for the previous post was because it was hard to cover exceptional behaviours without providing a simple introduction and building some kind of representation (in this case graphical) of the elements of such a pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This post moves on from that to discuss exceptional behaviours (what happens when a CompletionStage fails), and extends that graphical represention. Again, the basis for the information provided in this post is work I have been doing on the asynchronous version of the <a href="http://www.pac4j.org">pac4j</a> pac4j API and library, and settled on CompletableFutures as the way to represent the async API.

<h3 id="_introduction_to_completionstage_and_completablefuture">Introduction to CompletionStage and CompletableFuture</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2017-02-26</strong>
As mentioned previously I decided to expose the API for an async version of the pac4j API via the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html">CompletableFuture</a> class, using this to wrap values which will be determined in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As this work progressed, I learned that some of my default assumptions regarding error propagation in CompletableFuture (strictly <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletionStage.html">CompletionStage</a>) pipelines is incorrect. I&#8217;ve decided to document these, along with some exception-handling patterns, but ran into the fact that to do so, I probably needed to write an introduction to CompletableFutures and the CompletionStage API they implement. This article is a basic (and quick) introduction to the CompletableFuture/CompletionStage API, and will lead into subsequent articles on error propagation in CompletionStage pipelines, and approaches to handling exceptions raised during the pipeline processing.

<h3 id="_a_brief_introduction_to_the_vert_x_context_object">A Brief Introduction to the Vert.x Context Object</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2017-01-22</strong>
Recently I&#8217;ve been looking at the possibility of building an asynchronous version of the <a href="http://www.pac4j.org">pac4j</a>
library, with a view to then migrating the <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/vertx-pac4j">vertx-pac4j</a> implementation to use the
asynchronous version of pac4j by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m keen (for obvious reasons) that the async version of pac4j is not tightly coupled to  one
particular asynchronous/non-blocking framework, I decided to expose the API via the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html">CompletableFuture</a> class, using
this to wrap values which will be determined in the future. However, I opted to use the <a href="http://vertx.io">vert.x</a>
framework for my asynchronous testing as a way of testing the API as it emerged. This in turn has led me to learn
some aspects of the vert.x <a href="http://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Context.html">Context</a> class which I didn&#8217;t really
understand before.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2016-05-16</strong>
In the previous blog entry about AsciiDoctor, I recommended saving the generation command into a shell script or batch
file to make it easy to add additional processing/pre-processing later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While at the time this seemed very straightforward, for those of us who want to generate documentation as part of a
Java build, there&#8217;s a more convenient approach. There is a
<a href="https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin/">Maven plugin for AsciiDoctor</a> (Maven appears to have plugins
for just about everything), making it easy to generate documentation from templates as part of a Maven build. This in
turn can be  used in conjunction with other functionality provided by Maven (e.g. Maven resources plugin to move custom
css  into an appropriate location ready for upload to a website) to make a more complete build script.

<h3 id="_building_a_blog_with_asciidoc">Building a Blog with AsciiDoc</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2014-09-05</strong>
Given that we at millross have to write different kinds of documentation, it seems
less than ideal to write our blog in one markup language
(<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">MarkDown</a>), but other technical
documentation in AsciiDoc, so we thought we&#8217;d look at writing our own blog in
<a href="http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a> and generating HTML ready
for upload. This is how we went about it: it may not be the perfect (or even the
best) approach, but it&#8217;s how we got this blog up and running.
